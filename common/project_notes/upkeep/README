This is a reminder: Exercise and knee maintenence is so important for you; always take care of yourself first.
If you don't care for yourself, no one else will care for for you. Once you feel better; make sure you stay
that way.

Reminder: come up with symbolism for yourself; live life according to your principles
- Aristotle
