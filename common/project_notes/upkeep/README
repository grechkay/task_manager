This is the README for the upkeep project.
All meetings will be scheduled here.

I should implement reminder messages and longer term goals/ideas that aren't concrete enough to be tasks
All of these can be implemented as tasks.

This is a reminder: Exercise and knee maintenence is so important for you; always take care of yourself first.
If you don't care for yourself, no one else will care for for you. Once you feel better; make sure you stay
that way.

Reminder: come up with symbolism for yourself; live life according to your principles
- Aristotle

The three values you want to strive for are:

reason
competency
consistency

For both hearing and listening:

- Is it useful?
- Is it true?
- Is it good?
