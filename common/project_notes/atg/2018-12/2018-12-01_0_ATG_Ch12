ATG_Ch12

- When we say that someone has fallen on bad luck, we relieve that person of any responsibility. When we say that someone has had good luck, we deny that person credit for the effort that might have led to the happy outcome. p197
- All events, even those which on account of their insignificance do not seem to follow the great laws of nature, are a result of it just as necessarily as the revolutions of the sum. p198
- Chance is only the measure of our ignorance. p200
- The possession of actual money lulls our disquetude; and teh premium we require to make us part with money is the measure of our disquietude.
- Wherever insurance can be had, moral hazard - the temptation to cheat - will be present p206
- The guilty/not guilty hypothesis seems backwards p208.

In summary, the chapter was about risk management and hypothesis testing. It is ok, but not extraordinary.
