You'll to to Asya's place: 
Adress: 10 rue du bourg tibourg, 75004 Paris
Phone: 06 31 03 96 12 (with french area code: +336 31 03 96 12) 

The code for the outside door is 59A01
You will then see our mailbox (GRECHKA/LEQUERTIER). You can open this mailbox with any key (you just slightly put in the tip without going all the way in and then turn)
Inside the mailbox, you will see a small box with a code for keys. The code is 0512
You will find 2 keys, one "classic" green one and one thick gold one. The green one opens the door that will be right in front of you at the mailbox.
Our place is at the last and final floor, the thick gold key opens our door.
Wait for me there !!! :)
