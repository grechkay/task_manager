Francis Galton, Darwin's first cousin.

- London has the hottest girls, Aberdeen has the ugliest. 
- Average of guesses of ox weight was very close (wisdom of the crowd).
- He was fascinated with fingerprints since they never change; his work on the matter would influence the police to utilize them.
- He saught to limit the reproduction of people who were less talented or ill. Some people blame him for Hitler. p157

Quetelet

- Quetlet aiemd to define the characteristics of the average man; "if an individual at any epoch of society possessed all the qualities of the average man, he would represent all that is great, good, or beautiful. p159
- Cournot disagreed; "A totally average man would not be a man but some kind of monstrosity". (I agree with this point, consider the average 1 breast example) p160 
- In some sense, they aren't talking about the same thing, Quetelet probably is referring to a notion of 'median'.
- Heights of French conscripts revealed far too many who are too short; the conjecture is that these are 'draft dodgers'. p161
- "Quetelismus" to describe the growing popularity of discovering normal distributions in places where they did not exist. p162


- Galton wanted to prove that heredity alone was the source of special talents, but he found that 'eminence' has a short half life. Only 36% of the sons of eminent men were eminent and only 9% of grandsons. (This is actually still quite a bit, considering how rare so-called 'eminence' is) p.164
- He demonstrated the normal distribution with the 'Quincunx' p165.
- He demonstrated 'regression to the mean. p167
