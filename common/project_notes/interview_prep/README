I'll try to keep track of my interview prep; I want to prep for 4 hours a day and 12 hours on weekends.
I really want to get this job at HRT. I believe that this is my future. I'll write a note every day to track progress.

On the first day, I just want to code up some elementary data structures:
1) Union Find
2) BIT
3) DFS
4) BFS
5) BST (inorder, postorder, preorder)
6) heap (heapify)
7) Djikstra
8) A* algorithm
9) Bellman Ford

10) Binary Search
11) Insertion Sort
12) Quicksort
13) Mergesort
