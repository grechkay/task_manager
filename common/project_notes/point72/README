This is a project designed to complete the ML 'going private' prediction assignment.

So far, I registered at www.alphavantage.co with an API key of: G2COV3N7I14YHSRJ

I'm going to try to get some 'news data'; if possible I'll try to get some fundamentals data.
It looks like I should be able to scrape seekingalpha news articles; I will do this after I get confirmation on what data is allowed and what data isn't allowed.

After clarification with point72, it turns out that I'm even allowed to use payed data. As such I'll probably get some kind of free trial fundamentals data.

For tonight: try to scrape all of the data that you're planning to use; read the several papers that you have on the topic. Remember, the new basic task requirement is that you're in bed by 12, so don't waste time.
