This chapter was about Markowitz mean variance optimization; there is nothing too much of note. The one amuzing story is on page 259 when it talks about a group of hikers in the wilderness who come upon a bridge that would greatly shorten their return to their home base; the bridge is high, narrow and rickety. They put on the equipment and cross the bridge only to find a mountain lion waiting for them. The idea is that the notion of 'risk' is tricky to define.
- Warren Buffet sees volotiliy as an opportunity rather than risk. p261
- 'I didn't buy in order to sell' philosophy has a different notion of risk. p261
- Risk can have different time horizons.
