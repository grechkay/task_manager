WhyILeftMyphD

When I was doing my coursework and beginning to do my research, I was looking at a few different topics, but I had difficulty relating my potential research directions with my future career paths, and so I decided to leave my program for industry, where I would immediately work on practical problems. But throughout my career, I always continued to learn and did my best to keep up with the latest literature on topics which interest me.
