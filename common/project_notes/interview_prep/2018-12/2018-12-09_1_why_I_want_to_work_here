I am very interested in quantitative finance in general; I love the problem setting; I love the fact that we have clear unambiguous data. The clarity in the problem definition and the precision in the ground truth data allows for a much more precise approach in terms of utilizing mathematical models to solve the problem at hand.

In terms of Hudson River Trading, I only heard good things about your company. I like that you guys have a flat management structure, I like that you guys take a very scientific view of algorithmic trading, and I like that the coworkers at your firm spend recreational time together; this no doubt aids in their collaborative potential.
